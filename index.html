					<h2>Locating the User</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>IP Address</li>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Users can use VPN or Tor for anonymity</li>
							<li class="fragment">Not accurate for mobile networks</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Device GPS Sensors</li>

					<h2>Some Websites Provide Location-Oriented Pages</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Google.com</li>
						<li>Craigslist</li>
						<li>Google Maps</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>What's the Big Deal?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Modern browsers tend to cache static resources</li>
						<li class="fragment">Can't query the browser cache</li>
						<li class="fragment">But can observe the load time of the resource</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Threat Model</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Attacker has a website</li>
						<li>A victim visits their site and gets their browser cache probed</li>
						<li>Attacker can attempt to load location-based resources from popular sites to determine the victim's location</li>
						<li class="fragment">We are assuming the victim as rejected GPS access and is using IP Address masking services (VPN or Tor)</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Querying the Victim's Browser Cache #1</h2>
					<ul>
						<pre><code>&lt;img src="some-location-specific-resource" /&gt;</code></pre>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Save the start time and end time and compute the difference after the resource loads</li>
						</ul>
						<pre class="fragment"><code>var image = document.createElement(‘img’);
image.src = url;
image.setAttribute(‘startTime’, (new Date().getTime()));
image.onload = function()
{
	var endTime = new Date().getTime();
	var loadTime = endTime - parseInt(this.
	getAttribute(‘startTime’));
}</code></pre>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Querying the Victim's Browser Cache #2</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)</li>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Similar to the previous technique but make the request manually in JavaScript</li>
							<pre class="fragment"><code>var starTime, endTime, loadTime;
var xmlhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
xmlhttp.onloadstart = function()
{
	startTime = (new Date()).getTime();
}
xmlhttp.onloadend = function()
{
	endTime = (new Date()).getTime();
	loadTime = endTime - startTime;
}
</code></pre>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Querying the Victim's Browser Cache #3</h2>
					<ul>
						<pre><code>&lt;img src="some-location-specific-resource" complete="complete"/&gt;</code></pre>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Check the <i>complete</i> attribute of the image tag immediately after setting its <i>src</i> property</li>
						</ul>
						<pre class="fragment"><code>function cached(url)
{
	var image = document.createElement(‘img’);
	image.src = url;
	return image.complete || image.width+image.height > 0;
}</code></pre>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Querying the Victim's Browser Cache #4</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>&lt;iframe&gt;</li>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Similar to CORS, measure the start and end time then compute the difference</li>
						</ul>
						<pre class="fragment"><code>var page = document.createElement(‘iframe’);
page.setAttribute(‘startTime’, (new Date()).getTime());
page.onload = function ()
